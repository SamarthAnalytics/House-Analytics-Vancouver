Project Overview
This project investigates the key factors influencing residential property prices in North Vancouver. Using a real estate dataset containing variables like sale price, property features, and neighborhood details, the goal is to uncover meaningful insights for buyers, sellers, investors, and policymakers.

#Data Cleaning
Handled missing values (e.g., lot sizes for townhouses marked as "NA")

Treated extreme outliers using comparable property averages

Ensured consistent formatting for categorical and numerical fields

#Key Analyses
Trend Analysis: Examined price changes from 2010 to 2019

Feature Impact: Assessed how pools, waterfront views, and neighborhood affect price

Regression Modeling: Identified year sold and building size as top price predictors

Special features and desirable neighborhoods significantly increase property value

Age of the property has minimal influence on price

Regression model (R² = 0.746) confirms strong predictive power of selected variables

#Tools Used
Excel / Python (optional depending on actual tools used)

Statistical modeling (linear regression, pivot tables, descriptive analytics)
